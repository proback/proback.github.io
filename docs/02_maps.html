<p>The tricky part of choropleth maps is getting the shapes (polygons) that make up the regions. This is really a pretty complex set of lines for R to draw!</p>
<p>Luckily, some maps are already created in R in the <code>maps</code> package.</p>

<p>To add even more power and value to your plots, we can add interactivity. For now, we will use the <code>leaflet</code> package, but later in the course we will learn even more powerful and flexible approaches for creating interactive plots and webpages.</p>
